### May 10, 2016: Keyboard shortcuts, larger work area, better README
- Added zoom/pan keyboard shortcuts: Plus/Minus for zoom in/out and numbers 1 (full in) to 9 (full out) for quick jump between zoom levels (there may be [bugs](https://github.com/nypl-spacetime/nypl-warper/pull/44#issuecomment-218211933)).

- Increased the work and viewing area for maps (#11).
- Exposing some nice XML/JSON endpoints to sheets (#16).
- Improved README instructions to set up map warper server.
